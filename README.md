# C++ Piscine

This is a collection of 9 projects all realated to learning C++ each with a new subject to tackle.
As when we reach the cpp modules there's already a pretty decent foundation in C, we focus more on learning the language specifics.
Each project has a series of little exercises that makes us put to the test our newly found knowledge

## CPP00
* Introduction to the concept of classes
* Standard library

## CPP01
* C++'s smarter memmory management (new, delete, new[] and delete[])

## CPP02
* Ad-hoc polymorphism
* Operator overloading
* Orthodox canonical class form (OCCF)

## CPP03
* inheritance

## CPP04
* Subtype Polymorphism
* Abstract Classes
* Interfaces

## CPP05
* Repetition (making code more modular when needed)
* Exceptions
  
## CPP06
* C++ casts

## CPP07
* C++ templates

## CPP08
* Standard Template Library (Templated containers, iterators, algorithms)

## CPP09
* Still STL but here we learn the strengths and weaknesses of each container in C++98
